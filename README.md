## We've moved!

continue to support ring-ssl over at its new home.

# ring-ssl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/listora/ring-ssl.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/listora/ring-ssl)

A Clojure library designed to redirect all requests to your Ring app to
an https URL, inspired by [Rack::SSL][].

This library is useful when you don't have a webserver like Nginx
in-front of your application, for example, when deploying to Heroku.
